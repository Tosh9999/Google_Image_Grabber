# Google_Image_Grabber

Last Updated 2020-01-31

Uses Google Custom Search API to look for images and download them

This is meant to be a simple way to look for images for multiple search terms at a time and quickly pick among them which to download and turn into thumbnails.
It does not do unauthorized web scraping but rather uses the approved Google API.
